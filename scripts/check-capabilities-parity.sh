#!/usr/bin/env bash
# check-capabilities-parity.sh — assert the locked skill-capabilities taxonomy
# is identical in all three places it currently lives:
#
#   1. ALLOWED_CAPABILITIES bash array in install-skill-pack (the runtime allow-list)
#   2. The "## The taxonomy" markdown table in docs/CAPABILITIES.md (the operator docs)
#   3. The "# Capabilities taxonomy" header comment in install-skill-pack (cited by
#      the script body when emitting unknown-value errors)
#
# Drift between (1) and (2) is the failure mode Issue #301 flags: install rejects
# valid manifests OR accepts invalid ones, silently, while the error message points
# operators back at docs that are right while the script is wrong.
#
# This check runs in CI on every PR that touches either file so drift fails loud.
# It's the cheapest of the three directions Issue #301 outlined: no schema decisions,
# no source-of-truth move, both files stay where they are — but a divergent PR fails
# the check until both halves are updated in the same diff.
#
# Run locally:  bash scripts/check-capabilities-parity.sh
# Exit codes:   0 = parity OK, 1 = drift detected, 2 = script error (missing inputs).
