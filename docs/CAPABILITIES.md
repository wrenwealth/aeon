# Skill Capabilities Taxonomy

A **capability** is a self-declared blast-radius hint that a skill carries in its pack manifest. Capabilities surface at install time (`./install-skill-pack` and `./install-skill-pack --list`) so an operator can glance at what a pack can do — read-only? touches the chain? sends Slack? — before approving a `community` pack on a live agent.

Capabilities are **not** a gate. The trust boundary is still the operator + the security scanner + `trusted-sources.txt`. A skill that omits `capabilities` installs as before. A skill that declares them gets the listing surface for free.

---

## The taxonomy

The set is **locked** to the six values below. Unknown values are rejected by `install-skill-pack` with a clear error pointing back at this file. Adding a new capability requires a separate PR with rationale — this keeps the vocabulary stable so operators learn it once.

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `read_only` | No network writes, no on-chain calls, no notifications. The skill only reads (local files, public HTTP GETs to non-auth'd endpoints, on-chain reads). |
| `external_api` | Reads or writes to non-Aeon HTTP APIs — any auth'd third-party call (OpenAI, Twitter/X API, Discord webhook, Slack bot token, Postgres-as-a-service, etc.). Use this for any call that uses a secret. |
| `writes_external_host` | Modifies state on a non-Aeon host (POST/PUT/DELETE/PATCH against external services). Subset of `external_api` — declare both when the skill writes; declare only `external_api` when the calls are read-only. |
| `onchain_writes` | Signs and broadcasts blockchain transactions. The skill holds or proxies a wallet key and can move funds. |
| `agent_messaging` | Sends DMs, replies, or posts via X / Farcaster / Discord / Slack / Telegram or similar. Subset of `external_api` for the auth call, but called out separately because it speaks for the operator in public. |
| `sends_notifications` | Calls `./notify` (or the equivalent operator-alert path) — pings the operator's own channel, not an external audience. Lower blast radius than `agent_messaging`. |

### How to choose

Pick the **narrowest set** that's still complete. Examples:

- A skill that reads on-chain TVL and writes to `./notify` → `read_only`, `sends_notifications`.
- A skill that posts to X via the v2 API → `external_api`, `writes_external_host`, `agent_messaging`.
- A skill that fetches Coingecko prices and prints them in an article → `external_api` (Coingecko needs an API key for many endpoints; even free ones count as a third-party call).
- A skill that signs a Base txn rebalancing an LP position → `external_api` (RPC), `writes_external_host` (RPC POST), `onchain_writes`.

When in doubt, declare more than less. The listing surface only widens the operator's awareness — it never blocks.

## Schema placement

### Per-skill in `skills-pack.json`

```json
"skills": [
  {
    "slug": "vvvkernel-onchain",
    "capabilities": ["external_api", "writes_external_host", "onchain_writes"]
  }
]
```

### Pack-level in `skill-packs.json` (registry)

```json
{
  "repo": "baseddevoloper/aeon-skill-pack-vvvkernel",
  "capabilities": ["external_api", "writes_external_host", "onchain_writes", "agent_messaging", "sends_notifications"]
}
```

The pack-level field is the **union** of every skill's capabilities — kept in sync with the per-skill declarations so `./install-skill-pack --list` can summarise without fetching every pack tarball.

See [community-skill-packs.md](community-skill-packs.md) for the full schema reference for both files.

## Validation

`./install-skill-pack` runs strict allow-list validation when a manifest declares `capabilities`:

- Each value must match one of the six listed above (case-sensitive, exact match).
- Unknown values abort the install with an error message naming the invalid value and pointing at this file.
- An empty array (`"capabilities": []`) is treated as "not declared" — equivalent to omitting the field. A skill that genuinely does nothing externally should declare `["read_only"]` so the surface shows the intent.

No runtime gating — the install proceeds for any allow-listed combination. Capabilities are documentation, not a sandbox.

---

## Adding a new capability

The taxonomy is intentionally narrow. New values must:

1. Cover a **distinct** blast radius — something an operator would weigh differently from the existing six.
2. Apply to **multiple** skills, current or planned. One-off cases stay inside `external_api`.
3. Land in **one PR** that updates: this file, the `skills-pack.json` schema reference, and the `install-skill-pack` allow-list constant. PRs that add a capability without one of those three pieces will be sent back.

Closing a capability (deprecating a value) follows the same protocol in reverse — open a PR that migrates every existing pack first, then removes the value from the allow-list and this file in a follow-up.

---

## What this isn't

- **Not a sandbox.** A skill declaring `read_only` is trusted to be read-only; the runtime doesn't enforce it. The operator-plus-scanner remains the trust boundary.
- **Not a substitute for `trusted-sources.txt`.** Pack-level `trust_level: trusted` still requires the explicit trusted-sources listing — capabilities don't shortcut that.
- **Not an exhaustive permission model.** It's a coarse-grained hint so the install surface is informative. If you need fine-grained policy, that's a different feature.
